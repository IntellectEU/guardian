# THE PURPOSE OF THIS EMPTY-ish BRANCH AS DEFAULT IS INTENDED. 

# THE 'REAL DEFAULT' BRANCH IS STILL DEVELOP

## THE ONLY REASON OF ITS EXISTANCE IS THE GITHUB LIMITATION OF RUNNING SCHEDULED WORKFLOWS ON NON-DEFAULT BRANCHES. SO THIS BRANCH IS ONLY HERE TO HOST A COUPLE WORKFLOWS TO SYNC UPSTREAM ON DEVELOP AND MAIN BRANCHES. FOR THE SAME REASON ALL CODE FROM THIS BRANCH HAS BEEN REMOVED, AS A WARN TO AVOID PUSHING CODE HERE.
